# Rule: mdc-format

## Purpose

Defines the template used for `.mdc` and `.md` files in this repository. Keeping the format consistent helps both humans and Codex consume the rules without confusion.

## Structure

Each `.mdc` file should include the following sections when they apply:

1. **Title** - start with `# Rule: [name]` or `# Module: [name]`.
2. **Scope** - describe where the rule applies (module or entire project).
3. **Purpose/Instructions** - explain the goal and provide actionable guidance for AI or developers.
4. **Contracts** - optional; document API, UI, or logic commitments that must stay stable.
5. **Examples** - optional; add concrete usage examples.
6. **Anti-patterns** - optional; note behaviors to avoid.
7. **Metrics and Telemetry** - optional; list required logging or KPIs.
8. **Last updated** - optional; record when the rule was last revised.

## Writing guidelines

* Use plain Markdown; avoid embedding HTML.
* Split content into headings (`##`) and succinct bullets. Keep paragraphs short (no more than about 20 lines).
* Use tables for role matrices or mappings when needed.
* Update this file when you add important guidance or new modules.
* Write in clear, direct language and avoid repeating information that already exists in other rules.

## Updating rules

* When AI or developers violate a rule, update the related `.mdc` file with clearer instructions or add an anti-pattern that explains the failure.
* If a rule becomes obsolete, move it to a history or deprecated folder instead of deleting it outright, and update cross-references.
* Do not remove foundational rules that other contributors still rely on; create a new rule with a distinct name and link it if behavior changes.
