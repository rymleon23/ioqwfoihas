# Rule: linear-mapping

## Scope

Applies across all source code and documentation whenever core terminology is referenced. The rule keeps naming consistent and prevents confusion when mapping Linear concepts into Marketing OS.

## Instructions

* The canonical glossary lives in `docs/GLOSSARY.md`. Check it before renaming or adding terminology.
* When generating code or editing docs, attach `docs/GLOSSARY.md` and any relevant module docs from `docs/modules/` so AI keeps names aligned.
* Replace **Issue** with **Task** in UI and documentation output.
* Replace **Cycle** with **Phase**.
* Replace **Initiative** with **Strategic**.
* Avoid informal abbreviations. Capitalize proper nouns (Project, Strategic) consistently.

## Contracts

* You may keep third-party library names such as `linear-client`, but adapt outbound responses to the Marketing OS vocabulary before rendering them in the UI.
* Use the mapped names in commit messages and pull requests to match what users see in the product.

## Anti-patterns

* Do not leave helpers named `createIssue`; rename them to `createTask` or wrap them in an adapter that presents the correct name.
* Do not use "sprint" in this project; always say `Phase`.
* Do not rename enums provided by external packages. Translate names at the adapter or service boundary instead.
